## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on changing my career.
- 🌱 I’m studying for CompTIA A+, and I bought some old laptops to take apart as a learning resource. 
- 🙌🏼 I have completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting in to IT.
- 💬 Ask me about anything really, my experience before trying to change my career, the job market (or lack thereof), my path skipping from coding to cybersecurity to trying to get a help desk position ...
- 📫 How to reach me: ... you'll probably have to tag me in a comment or something, not sure how to securely add my contact details on here 😉
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to ride and race bicycles.
